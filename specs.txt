Specs and planning for awesome snake game:

	Some grandlines:

		Snake collects apples and gets bigger. 9 points per apple.
		Apple will spawn on an empty location.
		Game completed when screen is full of snake.
		Every object on screen should be an instance of gameobject class or its descendant.
	
	About classes:
			
		Location is represented with 'coordinates' class.
		Coordinate:
			constructor(x, y)
			set(x,y)
			get() -> x,y
		
		Gameobject:
			constructor(coordinate)
			moving(x,y):
			destroy()
			subclasses:
				wall
				apple
				snakehead
					check_collision(other)	
				snakebody

		Game_engine:
			add_points()
			reset_points()
			reset_game()

		Some thinking? - Done. Enough? - No.
